Font Awesome Free License
-------------------------

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and
GPL friendly. You can use it for commercial
projects, open source projects, or really
almost whatever you want. Full Font Awesome
Free license:

# Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License
(https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL
OFL license applies to all icons
packaged as web and desktop font files.

# Attribution
Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL,
and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded
comments with sufficient attribution, so you
shouldn't need to do anything additional
when using these files normally.

We've kept attribution comments terse, so
we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code.
They're a great way for folks tolearn about
Font Awesome.

# Brand Icons
All brand icons are trademarks of their

License.

resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of a
Source form, including but
not limited to compiled object code,
generated documentation,
and conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of
authorship, whether in Source or
Object form, made available under the
License, as indicated by a
copyright notice that is included in
or attached to the work
(an example is provided
in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work,
whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from)
the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations,
elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work
of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall
not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind
by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of
authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any
modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,

conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright
owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and
any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has
been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the
Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject
to
the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in
Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the
terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against
any
entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the
Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that
Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and
distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form,
provided that You
meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of
the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this
License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to
carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files;
and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form
of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright,
patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source
form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text
file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative
Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding
those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative
Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a
NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works;
within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the
Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices
normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for
informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may
add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text
from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution
notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement
to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different
license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution
of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the
Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You
explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the
terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms
or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement
you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant
permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or
product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and
customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the
content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required
by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions)
on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation,
any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such
as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including
any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages
of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the
use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses),
even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility
of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional
Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of
support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only
if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty
or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
